# RISC-V CPU



This project is a RISC-V CPU with 5-stage pipeline implemented in Verilog HDL, which is a course project of Computer Architecture, ACM Class @ SJTU.


## Design
 Feature | RISC-V CPU
--- | ---
ISA | RISC-V ([RV32I subset](doc/inst-supported.md))
Pipelining | 5 stages
Data forwarding | âˆš
Cache | N-way set associate I-cache and D-cache [1]
UART module | passed simulation [2]
Security | perfect proof against Meltdown and Spectre attack [3]

- 
- [1] UART module has not passed test on FPGA yet for the limited time. I re-designed part of CPU code to avoid hidden danger on FPGA, and it may need some more debugging.
- [2] Just kidding ;-) That's because the CPU is not with branch prediction or out-of-order execution.

This CPU project has a five stage pipeline with data forwarding.
In the picture below, red paths show stall control flow, while orange ones show data forwarding path.

For program test on FPGA without capable memory, this CPU uses UART protocol to communicate with PC, where runs a memory simulator.

## Simulation
This CPU is simulated with UART communication module in Xilinx vivado.
